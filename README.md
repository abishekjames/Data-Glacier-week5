## Deployment on Heroku

I have deployed the Api in Heroku 

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages

* To deploy the model on Heroku, put your project on GitHub and create a account on Heroku. Please use python as programming language while setting up the account.

* Then create a new app, connect your github repository to Heroku.

* Deploy the branch

Heroku charges based on usage, so I have deployed the app in Render. [Check it out](https://car-price-prediction-1l3u.onrender.com/)
